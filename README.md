## Synthetic Data Generation
Synthetic data generation is crucial for mimicking real-world health data. This involves creating datasets that reflect the characteristics of actual patient data while ensuring privacy.

- `data_generation.py` and `data_generation.ipynb` contain scripts and notebooks for generating synthetic data.

## Data Processing Pipeline
The data processing pipeline includes scaling, feature engineering, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

- `data_processing.py` and `data_processing.ipynb` handle data scaling, feature engineering, and train-test split.

## Neural Network Model using TensorFlow/Keras
The neural network model is built using TensorFlow/Keras. The model architecture is designed to predict disease outcomes based on input features.

- `model.py` contains the neural network architecture.

## Model Training & Evaluation
Model training involves fitting the neural network to the training data and evaluating its performance on the test data.

- `train.py` and `model_training.ipynb` are used for training the model.
- `evaluate.py` and `model_evaluation.ipynb` are used for evaluating the model's performance.

## Model Deployment Considerations
Deployment considerations include model serialization, API creation, and integration with healthcare systems.

- Ensure the model is saved in the `models/saved_models/` directory.
- Consider using TensorFlow Serving or Flask for deploying the model as an API.

## Requirements
Install the required packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to predictive analytics for disease prevention and early detection using TensorFlow. Follow the modular design and provided scripts to replicate the results and extend the project further.
